# AIOps Case Study: Automating Deployment Pipelines

**How AIOps Improves Deployment Efficiency**

1. **Automated Anomaly Detection**
   - Continuously analyzes logs and metrics to detect failures early.
   - Triggers automated rollbacks or alerts, reducing MTTR (mean time to repair).

2. **Intelligent Change Recommendations**
   - Learns from past deployment data to recommend optimal rollout strategies (canary, blueâ€‘green).
   - Suggests configuration tuning based on historical success rates.

These capabilities streamline CI/CD workflows, reduce manual intervention, and improve overall reliability.
